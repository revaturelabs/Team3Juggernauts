REST api
client-server characteristic

 The Client-Server principle works on the concept that client and server 
should be isolated from one another and permitted to develop independently.
The main reason that these should be isolated is scaling, as either end of
the workflow can be modified easier than if the two systems weren't separate.
Using the Client-Server architecture allows the workload of the system to be 
distributed accordingly (i.e. abstracting workload from client hardware 
to server hardware) to reduce workload on the client end. This allows 
all of the Rest api's characteristics to work in tandem with HTMl, which
also works off of a Client-Server based architecture.
