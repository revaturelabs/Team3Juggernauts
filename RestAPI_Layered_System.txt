 Rest_API: Layered System:


Although Rest APIs have many components, here we will be touching on its layered system. 
This system consists of numerous layers that work in cohesion and form a hierarchy. 
This multi-layered structure allows for encapsulation as well as scalability. 
Encapsulation because components with the layers receive zero interaction from outside layers. 
Scalability due to the fact that the layers can share resource caches.


Furthermore, this layered system is an architecture of servers where we can deploy the APIs on server 1, 
store data on server 2, and have requests authenticated on server 3 for example. There could be any 
number of layers fulfilling various roles, ranging from load-balancing, storing data, a security layer, etc. 
Best of all, the client is oblivious to the number of layers due to the efficiency of this architecture overall.
